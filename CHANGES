*** OLD STUFF ***

GNUpod 0.99.7

Summary
-------

I was planning to release GNUpod 1.0, but Heinrich Langos
flooded me with patches, many thanks to him:
- Fix DBID width in gnupod_search.pl output
- Added --bitrate switch to gnupod_search.pl
- Added --podcast-files-limit switch to gnupod_addsong.pl
- Added Podcast-Date patch (GNUpod now depends on Date::Parse)
- Added --unique switch to extractArtwork.pl
- Added xescaped() patch. GNUpod will now store
  non-ascii data escaped in it's GNUtunesDB.xml, however: you can still
  write UTF8 into the file using a decent editor (Such as Yudit).
  xescaped is now also a lot faster, giving GNUpod a nice speedup.
Stuff already in GNUpod 0.99.7 but missed in the 0.99.7 CHANGES file:
- XMLhelper.pm: Changed xescaped to use hex instead of decimal for 
  escaped unicode characters.
  Remove all inverted BOMs (Byte Order Markers) (not just the first) 
  that slipped through to xescaped.
  Fixing xescaped to always do byte matching and added some debug 
  output of dropped illegal characters.
- FileMagic.pm: Remove trailing zeros from MP3 tags that come in utf16 or utf8.
- gnupod_otgsync.pl: Marking files as played even when only the 
  skipcount or bookmark is > 0.
- gnupod_addsong.pl: Added other sources for artist tag data from podcasts.
  Added "--podcast-artwork" option to download and add artwork to podcasts.
  Added "--podcast-cache-dir" option allow caching of podcast media files.
  Fixed podcast XML parser handlers to merge CDATA that comes in chunks.
- extractArwork.pl: Added MD5 hash to "--unique" check.


GNUpod 0.99.6

Summary
-------

- Fixed M4A-Genre support (for numeric values)
- Use udevinfo to find the iPods Firewire-GUID (as /proc/bus/usb/devices is depricated)
- Support for iPhone: Edit ~/.gnupodrc and add 'model = iphone'
- Some documentation 'fixes', thanks a lot to Toby Cabot
- gnupod_addsong.pl: replace wget with curl
- Use binmode() more often to help Win32


GNUpod 0.99.5

Summary
-------
- Added Artwork-Support for Video, Nano and 2007-Nano iPods
  You'll need to set the value 'model' in your configuration file.
    See doc/gnupodrc.example for more details.
- Fixed Video-Podcast support for late 2007 iPods
- Fixed iPod GUID autodetection on linux. GNUpod 0.99.4 failed if the iPod
  was the last entry of /proc/bus/usb/devices
- The iTunesDB parsing code is now much more flexible and uses callbacks.
- Remove UTF8-BOM (Fixes garbage if source was UTF16 encoded)
- Removed broken lastfm support


GNUpod 0.99.4

Summary
-------
- Added README_FIRMWARE.txt file
- Added compilation-patch, thanks to Ray Lortie
- Rewrote mktunes.pl to be faster and more readable :-)
- Added support for 2007-iPods (iPod Classic, iPod Nano-2 and iPod Touch (?) )
  
  Apple attempted to lockout non-iTunes software by implementing an obscure
  protection using a sha1-hash. This sucked very bad.. for about 36 hours.
  This GNUpod release is able to overcome the silly protection. Thanks
  a lot to 'wtbw' for discovering some random numbers and implementing hash58.cpp
  
  Feel free to express your feelings about this
  issue at http://www.apple.com/feedback/ipod.html



GNUpod 0.99.3

Summary
-------

- Fixed invalid warning about broken mhip header. (tunes2pod.pl)
- Less stricter Podcast-Playlist parsing
- Reduced MP3::Info false-positives: Empty files are
  no longer detected as .mp3 files
- tools/fwpatch.pl: Support for video iPods added (yeah!)
- gnupod_convert_RIFF.pl: Support for new ffmpeg builds (s/aac/libfaac/)
- Upgraded from GPLv2 to GPLv3



GNUpod 0.99.2

Summary
-------

- Added support for Podcast-Playlists.
- Filter out bad chars from '--rename' command.
- Added RVA2 (Normalize) patch by Peter Liljenberg
- gnupod_INIT.pl: Added --noask option
- gnupod_addsong.pl: --playlist can now be used multiple times
- gnupod_addsong.pl: added --playlist-is-podcast command
- gnupod_addsong.pl: Added workaround for glibc/linux/perl bug/problem (realloc() error)
- Raised video-bitrate for on-the-fly converting
- Added configuration option 'automktunes'. Setting
  'automktunes = 1' inside ~/.gnupodrc eliminates the need
  to call mktunes.pl after adding/deleting/renaming songs because GNUpod
  will call mktunes.pl itself.
- Many internal changes / bugfixes to iTunesDB.pm like fixing an incorrect
  written mhip size. Playlist parsing has also been rewritten and cleaned up.
- Bugfix: Do not detect PCM files as movies when using --decode


GNUpod 0.99.1 - codename 'Klaus ist eine Wurst'

Summary
-------

- iTunesDB.pm: Added some new fields and SPL-Defs (Removes some warnings while running tunes2pod / gnupod_INIT)
- QTFile.pm: Search tracklength inside 'mdhd' as a fallback
- Added support for iPod-shuffle 2


GNUpod 0.99 - codename 'Pentarou'

Summary
-------

- iPod-Video support
  gnupod_addsong.pl can now read/add .mp4 files

  Converting .avi (RIFF) files on-the-fly works
  only IF your ffmpeg binary has AAC Support!
  (Adding preencoded files works witout ffmpeg)

  Try: gnupod_addsong.pl --decode=video *.avi

- Fixes a playlist problem with iTunes5 (new 100 Mhods)

- '--encode' didn't remove tempfiles from /tmp .. works again

- Added Support for .ape (MAC - http://sourceforge.net/projects/mac-port/) files (use --decode=foo)

- Added 'mediatype' support (for video) and stricter mhit parsing (for very old databases)

- Workaround for broken files written by 'Anapod'
  Set 'tunes2pod.anapodworkaround=1' inside ~/.gnupodrc
  to enable it. Enabling it slows down tunes2pod.pl
  (because it deactivates the fast-skip of the (useless)
   MasterPlaylist)

- QTFile.pm: rseek() now refuses to return more than 1024 kb. Fixes possible out-of-memory problems
             with broken files.

- Fixed an obscure gnupod_search.pl bug causing some weird search results.

- Added DESTDIR support (make DESTDIR=/tmp/bla install) and removed slackpkg target (obsoleted)


GNUpod 0.98.3 - codename 'Socke'

Summary
-------

- gnupod_addsong.pl can now fetch podcast-rss feeds!
  Example: 'gnupod_addsong.pl http://www.tagesschau.de/export/podcast'

- Added basic support for podcast-rss and podcast-guid in tunes2pod.pl and mktunes.pl

- Fixed small bug in FileMagic.pm: UTF16-Tags didn't work.
  Thanks to Chris Abajian for reporting this issue.

- Read TPE2 / TP2 for MP3-Files

=> Please note: Podcast support is still in BETA and 'real podcasts' are currently not supported



GNUpod 0.98.2 - codename "Jigen"

Summary
-------

- Changed the file-detection-type order
  of FileMagic.pm from:
  NonNative > QT > MP3 > PCM
  ..into..
  NonNative > QT > PCM > MP*

  ..MP3::Info had some false-positives and detected
  a few PCM-Files as MP3s :-/. The PCM-Detection
  is much simpler and shouldn't create any false-
  positives.
  Thanks to Stefano Vesa for reporting the Problem.

- GNUpod had some problems if the $IPOD_MOUNTPOINT
  contained whitespaces.
  Switched to File::Glob::bsd_glob() to fix this issue.

- iPod-Mini 1.4 Software is broken, avoid using it!
  -> Apple lowered the Max. Pathlength from 64 to
     55. GNUpod will now crop after 49 chars (who knows what
     Apple will do next time?)
     ..you can run 'gnupod_check.pl --fixit' to crop
     songs you added with an older version.
  -> Looks like Apple also broke the SmartPlaylists Liveupdate
     Feature. I couldn't get it to work with iTunes and GNUpod. Good job guys!
     Since GNUpod only supports 'liveupdate-smartplaylists', you can't
     use any SPL's with GNUpod and iPod-Mini 1.4 . Downgrading to 1.3 helps.

- gnupod_check.pl has now a --fixit switch. It will try to
  fix the found errors itself

- Updated documentation: Tell how to extract a
  Firmware-Image on Linux. (And others? Well, you need
  HFS+ Support)

  


GNUpod 0.98.1 - codename 'Lupin the 3rd'

Summary
-------

- Added support for multiple On-The-Go playlists.

- gnupod_addsong.pl can now reenocde aac and mp3 'on-the-fly'
  Usage: gnupod_addsong.pl --reencode 6 *.mp3
  This would reenocde everything with 'lame -V 6'
  Use this if you don't have much space left (iPod Shuffle?!)
  Note: The Reencode option also changes the quality of
        files converted with '--decode=' :-)

- Added support for m4a 'gnre' tags

- Fixed some iPod-Shuffle issues
   * mktunes.pl removes the iTunesShuffle leftover

- Remove TARGET-File if File::Copy() failed for any reason
   => Better handling of 'disk full' but still not perfect
      [GNUpod should write a 'sparefile' or something like that]


GNUpod 0.98 - codename 'Luna 9'

Summary
-------

- Support for iPod-Shuffle!
  (I do not know why Apple uses
   another Database for this thing!!!)
   Thanks to:
     * Chris Scott for testing and providing samples
     * Jeff Thieleke (From FooPod)
     * ..and Rodja Trappe (Samples + Testing)

- Fixed 'songnum' for ID3V1 Tags .. ouch

- Workaround for perl5.6 feature/bug
  'addtime' shouldn't be below zero anymore

- Write more tags for m4a files..

- Internal Change: Removed the ugly _itop and _x86itop..
  I hope i didn't break anything ;)

- Switched from Audio::FLAC to Audio::FLAC::Header



GNUpod 0.97 - codename guezli

Summary
-------

- 0.96 didn't write 'tracknum' for OGG Files, fixed now..
  Thanks to Ed Wandasiewicz for reporting this bug

- Read 'tracknum' on ID3V2 Files with 'TRK' Field

- Handle ID3Tags with Charset info

- You can now add MIDI files ;-) (with timidity)

- Added --set-songnum option for gnupod_addsong.pl

- Rewritten ConverterCore.. shouldn't break anything...

- gnupod_search.pl can now RENAME/Edit tags.
  use --rename="artist=New artist Name"

- You can now sort playlists:
  <playlist .. sort="artist"> or (reverse)
  <playlist .. sort="reverse title">

- Do not generate filenames longer than 64 chars..
  looks like the iPod Photo has a problem
  (Thanks to Mathieu Chouquet-Stringer for reporting)

- Added tools/fwpatch.pl. Allows you to convert an
  EU-iPod into an US-iPod (Make it louder)


GNUpod 0.96 - codename 'kartoffelsaft'

Summary
-------

- Changed --decode switch from gnupod_addsong.pl
  You can now select the output format of --decode
  -> pcm(old default) / MP3 (using lame) / AAC (using FAAC)  
  Example: # gnupod_addsong.pl --decode=mp3 *.flac
  (Idea and original patch from <daniel at kefa.co.uk>)

- GNUpod can now also convert OGG-Vorbis files
  (Use --decode=XXX, same as FLAC)

- Added --playlist=STRING switch to gnupod_addsong.pl
  This creates the playlist 'STRING' and adds all songs
  passed to gnupod_addsong.pl to this playlist.
  (Thanks to Bob Cotton)

- Many changes for the M4A parser, should work better now
  (Searches the SOUND Stream!)

- Write tracknum for AAC/ALAC files (doh!)

- Support for Bookmarks (Just rename .m4a files into .m4b)

- Convert strange Genre-Strings in MP3 Tags ( (17) -> Rock )

- Support for 'Playlist IDs' (Useless feature ATM ;) )


GNUpod 0.95 - codename 'sockentier'


Summary
-------

- GNUpod has now a configuration file! Read the docs or/and
  see doc/gnupodrc.example

- Added funky SmartPlaylist creator, see doc/mkspl.html
  (Needs JavaScript + DOM => Mozilla)
  ** SMARTPLAYLIST SYNTAX CHANGED **

- gnupod_addsong.pl can now add FLAC files.
  'flac' needs to be in your $PATH and it's disabled
  per default. (Enable it using gnupod_addsong.pl --decode
  or set 'gnupod_addsong.decode=1' in your config)

- gnupod_addsong.pl can read ALAC (Apples Loseless Audio Codec)
  files (iTunes creates normal .m4a files)

- Polished Playcounts parser (no hardcoded offsets anymore)

- added '--disable-v2' and '--disable-v1' to
  gnupod_addsong.pl (Disable parsing of ID3TAG version X)

- Fixed small bug with .m4a files and added more fields.
  gnupod_addsong.pl can now read M4A/AAC files from www.allofmp3.com

- added tools/m4a-info.pl: Use this tool to read Title/Artist tags
  from .m4a files (not installed by 'make install')

- You can modify the output of gnupod_search.pl using --view
  (See 'gnupod_search.pl --help')

- gnupod_addsong.pl checks for wrong extensions
  (like a mp3-file called 'test.wav'). The iPod wouldn't play
  such a file.

- Fixed some SmartPlaylist stuff and added support for last
  playtime

- Added gnupod_check.pl, it check's for 'lost' files

- I changed the 'build' system. Btw, you can now uninstall
  GNUpod using 'make uninstall' .. but why? :)

- Added manual pages

- GNUpod warns about case-sensitive mounted filesystems



GNUpod 0.94 - codename 'aspartam'


Summary (hmm.. it's a long summary..):
--------------------------------------
- Nobody did buy me a 40gb iPod with Firmware 2.x

- I bought one myself

- gnupod_addsong.pl understands .m4a files
  (= AAC Files written by iTunes)
  I don't know if it works with DRM files (.m4p?)
  I don't have any DRM files and i'm not interested
  in DRM files...
  If you like to see support for DRM files, send
  me a patch ;-)

- Added support for On-The-Go playlists!
  (2.x Firmware-only-feature)

- GNUpod can now handle the 'Rating' set
  on the iPod (2.x Firmware-only-feature)
  It does also update the Playcounts on v2
  iPods

- GNUpod checks if the iTunesDB did change and
  runs tunes2pod.pl if it has to run it

- Changed rating-schema to match SPL-Rating
  -> Rating 5 is now 100 (newrating=oldrating*20)
  mktunes.pl will drop old (= now invalid) ratings,
  no autoconvert... sorry.. but does anyone care?

- gnupod_addsong.pl understands ID3v2.2 tags

- You'll have to install Digest::MD5

- You can also call your GNUtunesDB
  GNUtunesDB.xml



Details:
--------

I removed the '-x' and '-i' switch, because
it wouldn't work well together with the
autosync

FooBar.pm:
 * connect() changed a lot

FileMagic.pm:
 * Stupid bug: We can now also read
   ID3v2.2 tags - Thanks to
   David Ranch for the Bugreport
 * Detect Arrays returned by MP3::Info
   (no ARRAY(XXX) on the iPod anymore :) )

iTunesDB.pm
 * Added 'Play Counts' parser (=Rating)
 * Changed rating Schema
 * _itop() checks for very big values and dies

QTfile.pm
 * A dirty QuickTime parser

gnupod_otgsync.pl
 * A new tool, don't use it yourself :)
   It's only used internal.



GNUpod 0.93 - codename 'Shorthorn'

Summary:
--------
- Reading MusicMatch files should work (again)
- gnupod_addsong.pl can add WAVE files
- Parsing large iTunesDB files should be faster
  (-> we skip the MainPlayList)


Details:
--------
iTunesDB.pm and co:
 * Can read and write Playlist-Elements without child
   tunes2pod.pl couldn't read files written by
   (newer) MusicMatch releases.. this should fix the issue :)
 * Don't parse MasterPlaylists, do a seek()
   -> Speeds up parsing
 * Read and Write SamplingRate (Helps audible.com files? ..no)

FileMagic.pm
 * Fixed (Again?) ID3 reading (Charset handling still broken?!)
 * Read SamplingRate for MP3 Files

XMLhelper.pm
 * Output is sorted




GNUpod 0.92 - codename 'frau beyersdorf'

-> This version supports SmartPlaylists (BETA!)

iTunesDB.pm:
  * Fixed the very old 'gnupod versus iTunes' bug
    -> iTunes shouldn't try to 'resort' playlist items anymore
       (Note: iTunes will ALWAYS re-sort the playlists.. that's
        a 'feature' of iTunes)
  * Added 'eq syntax check', you can use (since 0.90) 
    'eq="#!#NUMBER#!#' to specify the EQ-Setting per song.
    mktunes.pl will now check if this syntax is correct.
    (You'll see a warning if it failed)
  * Fixed get_string() to handle null-size strings correct
  * Changed some internal things (using hrefs.. etc)
  * Misc SPL-Related code

XMLhelper.pm:
  * Misc cleanups
  * Added SPL-Support
  * Added check for playlist duplicates
  * Fixed escape bug for <playlist name=..

FileMagic.pm
  * Fixed (?) ID3v2 reading

tunes2pod.pl:
  * Added paranoia checks (stricter parsing)
  * Added SPL-Read code (BETA!)

mktunes.pl
  * Added SPL-Write support
  * regex-matches are sorted by id

gnupod_addsong.pl:
  * duplicate-checker displayed the
    wrong number of the dup, works again





GNUpod 0.91 

Much changed from 0.90 to 0.91.
I removed XML::Simple and use (again)
XML::Parser (Event based GNUpod.. .. again)
0.91 needs much less memory...

I hope i didn't break anything.. but...


gnupod_search.pl:
  * -d doesn't delete all songs anymore.. hups..
  * Playlist-Cleanup works now.. (another stupid bug.. :-/) 
  * Added '--title' switch to usage

gnupod_addsong.pl:
  * Can read from STDIN again (use 'gnupod_addsong.pl -')
    (I forgot this feature ;) )

gnupod_INIT.pl
  * Added '--france' switch (Limit volume to 100 db for
    1.x Firmware)

mktunes.pl
  * New Playlist-Code.. MUCH faster now
    (Wow.. again? no.. the code of 0.90 was
     VERY slow with many files (~3000) and more
     than ~15 big playlists)
  * Added '--volume' switch: Adjust the volume on the iPod!
    Use something like 'mktunes.pl --volume 70' to boost
    the volume by 70% (same as volume="70" in the GNUtunesDB)

XMLhelper.pm
  * Fixed the cleandoc() bug
  * Dropped XML::Simple.. it's stupid :-/

..and..
  Changed 'Win' to 'Windows/W32/etc'





GNUpod 0.90

- This is a *COMPLETE* rewrite of GNUpod, expect new bugs
  and some new features ;)

Highlights:

- Faster (?)
- REAL Unicode Support (Perl 5.8 and 5.6, .. i hope!)
- Cleaner Code (?)
- Support for elements like 'playcount / volume .. etc' (Read the docs)


This release isn't perfect but it works nice and i think its good
enough to be released :)

No Support for AAC (mp4) and SPL (SmartPlayLists) in this release, 
but AAC Support will be added soon (GNUpod 0.91?) and adding
SPL Support is possible ;)


gnuPod 0.29-rc1
- Unicode Support!!
  Use an UNICODE Texteditor to edit the GNUtunesDB..
  (Like 'yudit' or the gnome2 texteditor)
  Your old latin1 GNUtunesDB will get converted to an
  UTF8 version after running tunes2pod.pl/gnupod_addsong.pl or
  gnupod_delete.pl

  UTF8 Support isn't testet very well, and gnuPod 0.28 maybe more
  Stable for you.. but as you can see: somebody is working on it ;)
- 'Rebuild' mode does now *never* check for duplicates
- gnupod_delete doesn't kill some playlists if you tried to
  kill ID 0


gnuPod 0.28
- Rewritten Playlistcode for tunes2pod.pl
- tunes2pod.pl doesn't kill your empty GNUtunesDB anymore
  if it can't find the iTunesDB
- mktunes.pl uses now binmode(), maybe this helps
  RedHat 8 ? .. (and win32 ;) )
- mktunes.pl is now *much* faster!!
- the GNUtunesDB written by gnupod_delete.pl looks
  nicer now :) (id= is now always the first element..)

gnuPod 0.27 codename 'codename'
- We are now on gnu.org
- Fixed 'creating playlists' sample in documentation.
- Firmware 1.1.0 can read FAT32, updatet documentation.
- gnupod_delete.pl doesn't kill regex playlists anymore (ouch)
- gnupod_search.pl supports -g(enre)
 (Thanks to Johan Ruttenberg)

gnuPod 0.26
- We are going to be a GNU package:
 > Support for LongOpts
 > Documentation aviable as TexInfo
 > GNU-Style build system (configure/make)
- You can now create (mktunes) and convert (tunes2pod)
  empty playlists (0 songs)
  This isn't usefull, but iTunes can do it and we should
  also be able to do it.
- tunes2pod supports now buggy, ehr. funny playlists
  written by MusicMatch
- Playlists are now sorted on the iPod as they are found
  in the GNUtunesDB - file
- mktunes.pl no longer accepts <playlist..> when </file> was
  not found.
- gnupod_addsong.pl handles long filenames now better
- Timestamp should now be set correct
  (utime(undef,undef.. didn't work on every OS..)
- new playist keywords. You can now use <regex ..
  to create a playlist using regular expressions.
  <regex is case sensitive, use <iregex if you want case INsensitive
  checking


gnuPod 0.25 (API-Freeze i think ;) )
- New Syntax (We use getopt)
- Many small bugfixes
- Fixed mktunes and tunes2pod 'touch' bug
- tunes2pod creates now a nicer XML file
- 'composer' added to gnupod_addsong.pl
- Fixed 'Genere' - 'genre' typo.. args!
 (Thanks to Guillaume Leclanche)
- gnupod_addsong.pl knows now winamp genres (NOT generes!! *doh!*)
- gnupod_addsong.pl can now read from stdin, for example:
  find /blabla/foo | gnupod_addsong.pl -gm /mnt/ipod -
 (note the -g switch (no need to press ENTER) and '-')
 (Many thanks to Scott Savarese)

gnuPod 0.22 
- Bugfix in tunes2pod for Perl 5.8
 (Many thanks to Orion Buckminster Montoya)
- tunes2pod typo corrected *doh!*
 (Orion Buckminster Montoya again :) )
- Support for tracknumbers like "01/18"
 (Many thanks to Darrell Golliher)
- Support for 'composer' tag (just in XML/iTunesDB, not ID3)
 (Thanks to Alexey Marinichev for providing the ID :) )
 
 
gnuPod 0.21
- Fixed stupid tunes2pod.pl bug with big iTunesDBs
 (Thanks to Ciamac Moallemi for reporting and providing a patch)
- Support for songnum, songs, cdnum, cds and year


gnuPod 0.2
- Changed to XML as file format
- Added Playlist support
- Support for new iTunes attributes


gnuPod 0.1
